# dmonesi-utils
A single repository holding many sub packages to host utilities I use daily. This repository contains multiple packages providing common Typescript utilities for miscellaneous project and environments. 

I organized packages to have minimum impact on project dependencies. This means that `dmonesi-utils.aws-amplify` - depending on package `aws-amplify` from NPM - and `aws-mobx-amplify` - depending on package `aws-amplify` and `mobx` from NPM - are two kept aside.

This is still a very early stage project, I will update it in the future.
